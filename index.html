        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <img src="images/thumbs_up_goku.jpg" alt="goku" id=my-image>
        <p> My name is Nathan Tshileo. I am a student at Algonquin College studying Interactive media design
        . Everyone can agree that I am athletic and that I like to workout. My favorite sports to play are
         basketball and soccer. I want to get a good education to make money to take care of my parents and
        to live a luxurious life. I can say that I am a responsible and hard-working student. Moreover, being
         a sociable person, I have many friends since I like to communicate with people and get to know new
         faces. With that in mind, I do not enjoy the lockdown because I can't go out and chill with my friends
